# IFrame

Embed an IFrame in the global component so you can display any website or web app.

With our App, you can easily embed external content into the deskpro website, streamlining your user's browsing experience.

Whether you're looking to display a map, a video, or any other web page, our IFrame App has got you covered.

_Some URLs do not support being accessed via an iframe, so when you get the error <website> refused to connect, it means it can't be loaded in an iframe._
